## Setup

Pro requires two pieces, both available in HACS:

### 1. UltraCard.io account

1. Visit **[UltraCard.io](https://ultracard.io)** and create an account.
2. Subscribe (or use the free trial — varies by promo).

### 2. Ultra Card Connect integration

The **integration** is a separate custom HA component that brokers communication between your HA instance and the cloud:

1. **HACS → Integrations → Add custom repository** → `WJDDesigns/Ultra-Card-Pro-Cloud`, category **Integration**.
2. Install **Ultra Card Connect**.
3. **Restart Home Assistant**.
4. **Settings → Devices & services → Add integration → Ultra Card Connect**.
5. Sign in with your UltraCard.io credentials.

After sign-in:

- The card editor shows your account in the top-right.
- Pro modules are unlocked.
- The **Ultra Card Hub** sidebar panel appears (served by the integration, not by HACS — it's why updating only the card doesn't update the Hub).
- Cloud sync / backups / snapshots run in the background.

---

## Cloud sync

- All card configs are encrypted in transit.
- Sync happens on save — a small toast confirms.
- Conflicts (two devices editing simultaneously) are resolved by last-write-wins with a snapshot of the loser's version automatically saved.
- See `src/services/uc-cloud-sync-service.ts` and `uc-session-sync-service.ts` for the implementation.

---

## Backups & snapshots

| Type | Trigger | Retention |
|---|---|---|
| **Daily backup** | Auto-scheduled (`uc-snapshot-scheduler-service.ts`) | 30 days, rolling |
| **Manual snapshot** | UI button or after major changes | Up to 30, FIFO oldest pruned |
| **Pre-restore safety** | Auto-snapshot before any restore | Counted toward manual quota |

Open from the **Cloud / Account** tab → **Backups** or **Snapshots**.

The restore dialog (`uc-snapshot-restore-dialog.ts`) shows a diff view so you can confirm what changes before reverting.

---

## Privacy & data

- Card configs sync to **ultracard.io** (a WordPress + custom REST stack).
- **No HA state data** is sent — only the card configuration.
- **Sensitive fields stripped on share** — when submitting a Marketplace preset, `uc-privacy-service.ts` strips IPs, tokens, image URLs, etc.
- **Open source** — all code is in this repo. The integration repo is `WJDDesigns/Ultra-Card-Pro-Cloud`.

If you cancel Pro, your existing data on ultracard.io stays for 30 days then is purged. Local card configs are unaffected.

## Troubleshooting Pro

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| Pro modules show "Sign in to use" | Integration not installed or signed-out. Re-add the integration. |
| Sidebar Hub missing | Update the **integration** (HACS), not just the card. The Hub ships from the integration. |
| Sync paused | Click the cloud icon in the editor — it shows the last sync error. Re-auth if needed. |
| Backups not running | Check **Settings → Devices & services → Ultra Card Connect → Configure → Snapshot schedule**. |
